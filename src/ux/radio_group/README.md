# RadioGroup

## Overview

The `RadioGroup` widget is a button group input control. It allows the users to select a single item from a short list of options. The widget is implemented using the Fluent Web Component `fluent-radio-group` and follows the Fluent Design System.

## Extensions

To improve consistency and overall usability, the widget has been extended with several features not provided by the Fluent Web Component.

### Label Support

The widget has been extended with a group-level label using a label slot inside the shadow root. This improves accessibility and clarity in form layouts. The label slot is mapped to the `label-text` widget property.

### Error Visualization

The widget has been extended with an error element slot inside the shadow root. This enables proper visualization of validation or formatting errors. An error icon is shown next to the radio group, with a tooltip showing the message on hover.

### Tooltip Support

Tooltips are automatically added to each radio button label text (representation) for horizontal layout. This ensures that button label texts are always accessible, especially when space is constrained.

#### `uproperties.ini` - IDE Property Inspector Configuration

The properties supported by the widget can be found in uproperties.ini.

## Customization

There are several ways to customize or enhance the widget's behavior. It is recommended to extend the widget class rather than modify it directly. This ensures easier maintenance and compatibility with future updates to the base widget.

#### Steps to Extend a Widget

1. Create a new widget class that inherits (extends) the base widget.
2. Override, remove, or add functionality as needed.
3. Add your widget configuration.

#### Using the RadioGroup widget as a Sub-Widget

Alternatively, depending on the use case, widgets can also be used as **sub-widget**.
